            The staff at the Barkshack has well over 50 years of combined experience, two additional groomers, certified pet handlers, and  a wacky sense of humor,  Despite our practical jokes on one another, we are very serious about the pets in our care. Pet safety comes first, cleanliness, then fun!    And we have a lot of fun!  We are former members of ABKA, American Boarding and Kennel Association, Pet Grooming Associations, and participate in many local pet rescue activites.
